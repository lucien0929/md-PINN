# md-PINN

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have become promising tools for solving complex partial differential equations (PDEs), but traditional PINNs suffered from slow convergence, vanishing gradients, and poor handling of local physical features. This paper proposes a mixed-depth physics-informed neural network (md-PiNN ) for solving the complex PDEs, aiming to improve the efficiency of network structure and activation function. The contributions are two aspects: (1) the md-PiNN includes the various mixed-depth blocks, each of which contains parallel connected deep sub-network and shallow sub-network. The deep sub-network captures global or fine-scale physical features, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the system; while the shallow sub-network focuses on localized details or coarse-scale physical features, facilitating stable training of very deep networks. (2) the md-PiNN introduces a novel nest-tanh (.) activation functions with nested mechanism in shallow sub-networks to enable efficient extraction of complex features using fewer hidden layers, reducing reliance on deep networks. By incorporating mixed-depth structures, md-PiNN enables more efficient information sharing across different layer, leading to faster convergence and improved training efficiency. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that md-PiNN avoids suboptimal convergence with appropriate initialization. The proposed approach is validated across multiple PDEs, including heat transfer scenarios with complex boundaries, bi-material solid mechanical problems, Allen-Cahn equation, and fluid dynamics. Results show that md-PiNN exhibits the superior capabilities in approximating and capturing intricate system features. These findings underscore the computational efficiency and potential of md-PiNN in tackling real-world and complex problems.
